Microsoft Game Jame - Sum Stacker!

The theme of the game jam was education and Sum Stacker taught players how to add quickly.
Blocks with positive or negative numbers on them are dropped from the sky, and the player had to create rows or columns that added up to 10.
When that happens, that row or column would disappear and the user's score increased.
The game ends when player cannot clear fast enough and the blocks overflow from the top.
We had a fun time making the game in the span of about 10 hours and the panel of Microsoft judges awarded us third place in the completion.

**Link:**  
The game can be found on our github page [Sum Stacker](https://github.com/krytical/SumStacker) and a complied build is available for download at [Source](https://github.com/krytical/SumStacker/blob/master/SumStacker/Builds/Builds.rar?raw=true).

**Team:**  
The team was made up of 4 people (4 developers). 

**Work:**  
The game was written using C# and Unity 3D Engine.
I worked on spawning blocks, block transformation, column sum calculations, and column deletion.
