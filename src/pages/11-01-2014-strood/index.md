Strood! Street food!  

**About:**  
The Google Web Toolkit app that locates street food vendors around Vancouver. 
Street food trucks are always moving around and it can be a hassle to find their location. 
With Strood, users can find their closest street food vendor by sharing their location or locate the location of their favourite vendor.
They can choose to create an account and save their favourite vendors. 
And if they really enjoyed their experience, they can share it on social media (Twitter).  

**Link:**  
The Github repository is a private, but the project was deployed to Google AppSpot and can be found at: [Strood Website](http://1-dot-strood123.appspot.com/) (no longer supported).

**Team:**  
We called our team "The Fantastic Four" and it likewise consisted of 4 people. 
Individual tasks were organized and assigned during weekly scrum meetings. 
The project was complete in November 2014 and lasted around 3 weeks.

**Work:**  
The project was written using Java, HTML, CSS, and Google Web Toolkit (GWT). 
And a parser was developed to read the datasets from [DataBC](https://data.gov.bc.ca/).
I worked on the functionality and logic of various website features. 
This mainly consisted of the rating system, favourite system, and the object structures.
