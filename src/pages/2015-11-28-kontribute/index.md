Kontribute is a mobile event planning app that is supported on all mobile platforms.
The host is able to create an event page that contains information such as location, time, attendees, and a list of required party items.
On the other hand, attendees are able to choose the items that they can bring to the party and share the event on social media (Facebook and WhatsApp).
Events can be easily organized by using template lists that contain items that are typically needed for a type of event (e.g. football night, house party)
Moreover, the list system divides up responsibilities and ensures just the right amount of supplies for the event.

**Work:**  
The app was implemented using AngularJS, Ionic, and Parse (originally used Firebase).
I implemented the list system, various UI logic, and features such as default templates and creating custom templates.
