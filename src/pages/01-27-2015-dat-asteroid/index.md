Game Jam Vancouver 2015 - Dat Asteroid!

**About:** 
In the span of 48 hours, our team made a 2 player game, where the objective was to shoot an asteroid to the opponent's goal.
The game has spaceships that shoot lasers, an asteroid that interacted with all physical objects, and a fun soundtrack.
We demoed the game at the end of the event and had a lot of fun playing it.

**Team:**  
The team was made up of 7 people (6 developers and 1 music producer). 
It was a very fun event and I met over half of my team members at the event.

**Work:**  
The game was written using C# and Unity 3D Engine.
I worked on the audio mechanics, audio interactions, and some UI functionalities.
