Game Jam Vancouver 2016 - Source!

**About:** 
This was my second time at the Vancouver Game Jam. 
Our team was able to make a very simple platformer game in the span of 48 hours.
Most of the team's time was spent designing levels and creating custom 3D art assets for the environment and interactable objects.
As a result, the game was visually appealing, but the game's mechanics were that of a generic platformer (e.g. dodge fireballs and jump to reach platforms).

**Link:**  
The game can be found on our Global Game Jam 2016 page: [Source](https://globalgamejam.org/2016/games/source).

**Team:**  
The team was made up of 7 people (3 developers, 4 artists). 

**Work:**  
The game was written using C# and Unity 3D Engine.
I worked on all the major aspects of the fire level. 
This included designing the map and implementing moving platforms, fire hazards, and environmental triggers.
