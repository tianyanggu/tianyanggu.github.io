Blank Space Games is a small mobile game development studio formed from a group of UBC students. 
All of the games have been deployed to the Google Play Store.

[Orange Cube](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.BlankSpace.OrangeCube) is a runner game, where you tap to change directions and try to keep on the ever changing pathway. 
Turning perfectly increases your cube's size and awards bonus points.
As the game speeds up, avoid becoming too small or falling off the edge.

[This Side Up](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.BlankSpace.ThisSideUp) is a platformer game, where you play as a cat and the floor is lava. 
Charge your jumps, beat the global high score, and try out all the different cats (there are rumours that a dog can be unlocked too).

[Pixel Switch](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ca.BlankSpace.PixelSwitch) is a reflex game, where you switch between poses to fit through the matching walls segments.
Don't crash into the walls as the speed of the game ramps up.

**Work:**  
The games were written using C# and Unity 3D Engine.
I took on varied roles for the games such as the soundtrack, QA testing, and minor feature implementation.
